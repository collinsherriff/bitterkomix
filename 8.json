  "description": "This stunning photo of Siya Kolisi in full defensive action would make a beautiful poster or digital background. Photographer Howard Cleland captured the energy of the game in 3387x2349 print-quality resolution. The winning bidder will receive an NFT that gives them ownership of this photograph, and exclusive access to the high-resolution version. The full price of the winning bid will go towards the clean-up efforts in KZN. If the NFT is resold again in future, 10% of the sales price will go back to The Sharks' charitable efforts."
