  "description": "This NFT grants the bearer and one guest access to the President's Box at Kings Park during Sharks games. Treat yourself and a friend to this unique and luxurious experience in the Kings Park President box and enjoy the games like never before. The NFT can be traded freely, which means its value could increase as the demand for such a ticket rises. The full price of the winning bid will go towards the clean-up efforts in KZN. If the NFT is resold again in future, 10% of the sales price will go back to The Sharks' charitable efforts. Terms & Conditions The NFT can be used to redeem two visits to the President's Box per calendar year, regardless of the holder (i.e. trading the NFT does not reset the remaining number of visits for the year). Valid for home games at Kings Park Stadium. Valid for at least five years. May be extended at the sole discretion of The Sharks."
