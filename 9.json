  "description": "Photographer Howard Cleland captured The Sharks in a relaxed moment in the locker room and provides a unique behind-the-scenes insight for Sharks fans. The digital photograph is in print-quality 3387x2349 resolution and would make a beautiful poster in any fan's room or as a digital background. The winning bidder will receive an NFT that gives them ownership of this photograph, and exclusive access to the print resolution version. The full price of the winning bid will go towards the clean-up efforts in KZN. If the NFT is resold again in future, 10% of the sales price will go back to The Sharks' charitable efforts."
